/*
* Version 1.0
* 		- Initial release.
* Version 1.0.1
* 		- Now works with sv_cheats off (thanks TESLA-X4 for the idea).
* Version 1.0.2
* 		- Fixed the two ConVars so they no longer cause error messages in client consoles when connecting.
* 		- Corrected some spelling mistakes in the comments that were bugging me.
* Version 1.0.3
* 		- Fixed ArrayOutOfBounds error.
*			- Seperated Blind Luck configuation into cfg/sourcemod/plugin.blindluck.
* Version 1.1.0
*     - No longer requires the spoofing of sv_cheats. This gets rid of the client messages.
*     - Added ConVar 'bl_hud_to_apply' to allow administrators to decide which parts of the HUD to hide.
*     - Event 'player_no_longer_it' is now unhooked when it is not needed. 
*     - Added minimum and maximum values to 'bl_blind_time'. The maximum time is 25 seconds with the minimum being 5 seconds.
*     - Now compiles without indentation warnings.
* Version 1.1.1
*     - Fixes error when restoring the HUD on some entities.
